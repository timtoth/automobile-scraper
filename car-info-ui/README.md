## Auto Scraper
Plans to scrape auto sites for car prices and ping the user when something they desire is found.

# TODO
Search/Filtering: Adding an input field to filter the car list by Make, Model, or Year.

State Management: Implementing a feature that requires shared state (e.g., adding a car to a "Favorites" list).

Detail View: Making the cards clickable to show a /car-info/inventory/:id detail page.
